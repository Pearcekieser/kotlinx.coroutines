/**
 * Channel with array buffer of a fixed capacity.
 * Sender suspends only when buffer is full and receiver suspends only when buffer is empty.
 *
 * This channel is created by `Channel(capacity)` factory function invocation.
 *
 * This implementation is blocking and uses coarse-grained locking to protect all channel operations.
 * However, removing a cancelled sender or receiver from a list of waiters is lock-free.
